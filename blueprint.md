# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a modern and professional website for a company specializing in low-current systems. The website will showcase the company's services, highlight its expertise, and provide clear calls to action for potential clients.

## Design and Features

### Version 2.0 (Current)

*   **Color Palette:** A bold, vibrant, and futuristic color scheme. The design uses a deep space-blue background (`#0C0C1D`), with electric blue (`#007BFF`) and bright cyan (`#00F2FF`) as primary and accent colors, creating a high-tech and energetic feel.
*   **Typography:** The 'Poppins' font is used for its clean, modern, and highly readable characteristics, perfect for a tech-focused company.
*   **Layout:** A responsive and visually balanced layout that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Visual Effects:**
    *   **Noise Texture:** A subtle noise texture is applied to the main background to add a premium, tactile feel.
    *   **Gradients:** Buttons and other key elements feature vibrant linear gradients.
    *   **Glow Effects:** Soft, deep shadows and colored glows are used to create a sense of depth and make interactive elements pop.
    *   **Glassmorphism:** The header uses a frosted glass effect to appear modern and float above the content.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Header:** A sticky, semi-transparent header with a frosted glass effect.
    *   **Hero Section:** A prominent section with gradient text and a glowing, pill-shaped call-to-action button.
    *   **Features Section:** Cards with a lifted appearance, rounded corners, and a subtle glow.
    *   **About Section:** Styled to match the new, modern aesthetic.
    *   **Contact Section:** A redesigned contact form with styled inputs and a gradient button.
    *   **Footer:** A modernized footer that is consistent with the overall design.

## Current Plan

1.  **Update `blueprint.md`:** Document the new design system.
2.  **Import Font:** Add the 'Poppins' font from Google Fonts in `app/layout.tsx`.
3.  **Create Background Texture:** Add an SVG file for the noise texture.
4.  **Overhaul CSS:** Rewrite `app/globals.css` to implement the new design across all components.
